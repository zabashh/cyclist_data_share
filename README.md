## Project Structure

Our project is organized as follows:

- `data/`: Contains the dataset files used for analysis.
- `analysis/`: Includes R scripts and notebooks for data analysis.

## Data Sources

We used publicly available data provided by Cyclistic for this analysis.

## Key Questions

Our analysis focuses on answering the following key business questions:

1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

## Analysis and Visualizations

We have conducted data analysis and created various visualizations to answer these questions. Key findings and visualizations can be found in the analysis report.

## Conclusions

Our analysis has provided valuable insights into the behavior of annual members and casual riders. Detailed conclusions can be found in the analysis report.

## Recommendations

Based on our analysis, we propose the following top three recommendations:

Recommendation 1.

    Digital Media Strategy: Utilize digital media channels like social media, email marketing, and app notifications to reach out to casual riders.          Create engaging content that highlights the benefits of becoming an annual member, such as unlimited rides and access to special events.

 Recommendation 2.

    Pricing Strategy: Consider adjusting pricing plans to make annual memberships more attractive, such as offering lower introductory rates or bundling     memberships with other services like public transportation.
      
 Recommendation 3.

    Partnerships and Collaborations: Explore partnerships with local businesses, corporate offices, or universities to offer discounted annual               memberships to their employees or students, potentially converting more casual riders into annual members.
